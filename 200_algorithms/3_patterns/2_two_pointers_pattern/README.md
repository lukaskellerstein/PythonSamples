Two pointers is most common with linear structures, but it shows up in other places too.
Mostly linear, yes:

Arrays
Strings
Linked lists

But also appears in:
Trees — problems like "find if there's a pair summing to k in a BST" use two pointer logic with an in-order iterator going forward and backward simultaneously.
Graphs — Floyd's cycle detection applies to any sequence that can cycle, like the Happy Number problem where there's no data structure at all, just a number sequence.
Matrices — searching in a sorted matrix can use a two-pointer approach starting from a corner.
